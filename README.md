# CarePilot AI

CarePilot AI is a research-focused project exploring how agent-based large language models (LLMs) can be applied to medical diagnostics.  
The system processes clinical case reports, distributes reasoning across multiple agents, and generates a unified diagnostic output.  
This serves as a proof-of-concept for AI-assisted healthcare research.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: CarePilot AI is for **educational and experimental purposes only**. It is not designed or approved for clinical use.
