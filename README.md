# 1️⃣ **DiagnoDrive**

````markdown
# DiagnoDrive

DiagnoDrive is an experimental framework that uses multi-agent large language models (LLMs) to process medical case reports and generate structured diagnostic summaries.  
The goal is to explore how agent-based reasoning can improve interpretability in healthcare research.

⚠️ Disclaimer: DiagnoDrive is for **research and education only**. It must not be used for real medical decision-making.

---

## Key Features
- Agent-based pipeline for analyzing clinical reports.  
- Consolidates reasoning across multiple steps.  
- Easy to customize with different agent roles.  
- Saves generated outputs for later review.  

---

## Installation

1. Install **Python 3.10+**.  
2. Set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
````

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add API credentials in `apikey.env`:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

---

## Running the Project

```bash
python Main.py
```

* Input: Case reports (text files).
* Output: Diagnostic results in the `Results/` directory.

# 2️⃣ **CarePilot AI**
```markdown
# CarePilot AI

CarePilot AI is a research-driven project that applies lightweight agent-based LLMs to medical diagnostics.  
The system orchestrates multiple agents to analyze case reports and synthesize a unified assessment.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Educational use only. Not a medical product.

---

## Features
- Modular, agent-oriented design.  
- Generates structured diagnostic summaries.  
- Works with customizable input formats.  
- Results stored automatically for inspection.  

---

## Installation
1. Python 3.10+  
2. Virtual environment setup:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
````

3. Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. API key in `apikey.env`:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
   ```

---

## Usage

```bash
python Main.py
```

* Inputs: Case reports.
* Outputs: Stored in `Results/`.

# 3️⃣ **Clinisight**
```markdown
# Clinisight

Clinisight is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating how language model agents can provide structured insights from unstructured medical reports.  
The project focuses on creating transparent reasoning chains for healthcare research.

⚠️ Clinisight is **not a diagnostic tool** and must not be used in clinical practice.

---

## Highlights
- Multi-agent orchestration for medical reasoning.  
- Simplified pipeline, easy to extend.  
- Compatible with standard Python environments.  
- Output designed for interpretability.  

---

## Setup
1. Requires **Python 3.10+**.  
2. Virtual environment (recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
````

3. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Place API credentials in `apikey.env`.

---

## Execution

```bash
python Main.py
```

Results appear in the `Results/` folder.

---

# 4️⃣ **MediAnalytiX**
```markdown
# MediAnalytiX

MediAnalytiX is a lightweight Python framework built to explore the role of AI agents in clinical diagnostics.  
It processes medical case reports, routes them through dedicated reasoning agents, and produces synthesized diagnostic insights.

⚠️ Educational / research-only project. Not validated for clinical use.

---

## Core Features
- Modular agent-based reasoning.  
- Results written automatically to disk.  
- Designed for experimentation with different medical datasets.  
- Clear separation of input, processing, and output.  

---

## Installation
1. Python 3.10+ required.  
2. Virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
````

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add API key:

   * Create `apikey.env` with your credentials.

---

## Running

```bash
python Main.py
```

Outputs will be saved in the `Results/` folder.
